They may not participate in the room until they join.\n\n- ``join`` - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.\n\n- ``leave`` - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).\n\n- ``ban`` - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than ``ban``).\n\n- ``knock`` - This is a reserved word, which currently has no meaning.\n\nThe ``third_party_invite`` property will be set if this invite is an ``invite`` event and is the successor of an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event, and absent otherwise.\n\nThis event may also include an ``invite_room_state`` key **outside the** ``content`` **key**.

The other is documented in the*\n`joining rooms section`_.\n\nThis API invites a user to participate in a particular room.\nThey do not start participating in the room until they actually join the\nroom.\n\nOnly users currently in a particular room can invite other users to\njoin that room.\n\nIf the identity server did know the Matrix user identifier for the\nthird party identifier, the homeserver will append a ``m.room.member``\nevent to the room.\n\nIf the identity server does not know a Matrix user identifier for the\npassed third party identifier, the homeserver will issue an invitation\nwhich can be accepted upon providing proof of ownership of the third\nparty identifier. This is achieved by the identity server generating a\ntoken, which it gives to the inviting homeserver. The homeserver will\nadd an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event into the graph for the room,\ncontaining that token.\n\nWhen the invitee binds the invited third party identifier to a Matrix\nuser ID, the identity server will give the user a list of pending\ninvitations, each containing:\n\n- The room ID to which they were invited\n\n- The token given to the homeserver\n\n- A signature of the token, signed with the identity server's private key\n\n- The matrix user ID who invited them to the room\n\nIf a token is requested from the identity server, the homeserver will\nappend a ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event to the room.\n\n.. _joining rooms section: `invite-by-user-id-endpoint`_",

They may not participate in the room until they join.\n\n- ``join`` - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.\n\n- ``leave`` - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).\n\n- ``ban`` - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than ``ban``).\n\n- ``knock`` - This is a reserved word, which currently has no meaning.\n\nThe ``third_party_invite`` property will be set if this invite is an ``invite`` event and is the successor of an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event, and absent otherwise.\n\nThis event may also include an ``invite_room_state`` key **outside the** ``content`` **key**.
